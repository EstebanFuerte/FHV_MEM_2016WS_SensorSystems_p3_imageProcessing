%A robust skin color based face detection Algorithm
	3 Algo tested/Analized + Eigen => 95,18% accuracy
	Color processing much faster than other facial features
	Color is orientation invariant -> Motion estiamion much easier
	Chromaticty will be used ->  YCbCr (most used)
	Color = most populer algo; often first step for detection
	RGB  = for computer RGB are highly correlated -> difficult to execute image processing algorithmus
	Histogram analyisis work on intensity components => RGB is not a good space for face detection
	YCbCr => widly used model in a digital video domain
	YCbCr => good for comprimenting data
	!!! Thes color space seperate RGB information into luminance(Y) and chrominance information. => chrominance will be used for further processing (CbCr)
	HSI	=> 
	Algo: 1. Classify the skin region 2.Apply threshold to mass the skin region 3.draw bounding box to extract the face image
	RGB => 56% erkennung
	YCbCr => 83.91 % Erkennung
	HSI => 82.27 %

%Face Detecion Using Color Thresholding, and Eigenimage Template Matching
	Main advantage of YCbCr is that the influence of luminosity can be removed.
	All informaion about the brightness informaion is given by the Y component.
	Cb (blue component) and Cr (red component) are independent from the luminosity Y.
	Cb & Cr give a good indecation if the color is a skin color.
	Calculation of Y, Cb and Cr abased on RGB
	-- Defined Thresholds 140 < Cr <165; 105<Cb <135; Offset = +128 bei Cb, Cr
	Binary Image processin (erosion and dilation?)
	Regions with less than 17 pixels can not be faces.

%Face to Face - Face Recognition in Color Images using Matlab
	Erosion and dilation = morphological operations.
	simple images (clear background, only one faces ...)
	Light compensation -> see further [2]
	Significantly reduce pixels to find faces (less computation effort)
	High Cb and Cr values in the region of the eyes
	For varying ilumination better performance.
	-- Defined thershold values 0,31 < Cb < 0,75; 0,56 < Cr < 0,7
	
	

%Real Time Detection and Tracking of Human  Face using Skin Color Segmentaion and Region Properties
	Uses all 3 models
	After skin like pixels detection we convert this segmented image into a binary form.
	This binary image contains skin regions but not only faces.
	Using human face featuers and region properties (distances eye - mouth)
	Firstly, processing skin color is simpler than processing than other facial features.
	Secondly, under certain lightning conditions color is orientation invariant.
	Intensity = mayser diff between skin tones.
	Extensive used in digital video coding applications
	Thresholding is used because it is faster
	Face detection mit dem HSI model - H  value should be in the range 0 - 0.1 S in the range 0.2 - 0.7; Independent of I.
	-- Defined threshold value - 125 < Cr < 165; 76 < Cb < 126
	95% with near frontal image
	Different approach to detect faces. (small area, euler number eccentricity, bounding box properties, centroid)
